Input: a set of points S = {P = (P.x,P.y)}

    Select the rightmost lowest point P0 in S.
    Sort S angularly about P0 as a center.
        For ties, discard the closer points.
    Let P[N] be the sorted array of points.

    Push P[0]=P0 and P[1] onto a stack W.

    while i < N
    {
        Let PT1 = the top point on W
        Let PT2 = the second top point on W
        if (P[i] is strictly left of the line PT2 to PT1) { 
            Push P[i] onto W
            i++    // increment i
        }
        else
            Pop the top point PT1 off the stack
        
    }

    Output: W = the convex hull of S.
