<h3>
Simulating an HMM, Viterbi's Algorithm
</h3>
</p>

<p>
On pages 388-397 in Jones and Pevzner, they discuss an HMM model for
coin tossing.
</p>

<p>
Write a program that simulates the running of the dishonest casino
model for N cycles, where N is taken from the command line, then
using Viterbi's algorithm with only the
emitted sequence output, find the most probable state path that
produces that output.  Write it so that the parameters, the state
transition probabilities and the emission probabilities, can be
read from input files.  The output is written to an output
file.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Command line</h4>
</p>

<pre>
	./casino &lt;transition prob&gt; &lt;emission prob&gt; &lt;output file&gt; &lt;N&gt;
</pre>

<p>
<h4> Input </h4>
</p>

<p>
The first line of the file of transition probabilities contains the number
of nodes including the start node.  Say that this number is S.
</p>

<p>
The transition probability matrix contains a SxS set of numbers
in S rows of S columns.  Say that the value in row i and column j,
0 &lt;= i &lt;= S and 0 &lt; j &lt; S, is p[i][j].  The state 0
is a start state.  The value of p[i][j] is the probability of moving
from state i to state j.
</p>

<p>
There should be a 50-50 chance of moving from the start state to the
fair state (state = 1) or to the loaded state (state = 2.)  There
should be no transitions allowed from any state to the start state,
not even from the start state to itself.
</p>

<p>
The transition probabilities should be in S rows of S values, each value
in 5 digits after the decimal point as in '.12345'.
</p>

<p>
Before the emission probabilities is a line that contains the number
of letters in the alphabet, thus giving the number of rows of the
emission matrix.  In our case the number will be 2.
</p>

<p>
The emission probabilities make up a SxB matrix in S rows of
B columns.  The first row contains the probabilities for
emission of heads or tails with the fair coin.  And the
second row contains the probabilities for emitting a heads or
tails with the loaded coin.  The row sums should be 1.0.
</p>

<p>
The emission probabilities should be in S rows of B values, each value
in 5 digits after the decimal point as in '.12345'.
</p>

<p>
Run the HMM machine, put the generated state sequence aside in an array.
Use the emitted sequence together with Viterbi's algorithm
to find the state sequence of N states that has the highest
probability for emitting the sequence generated by the first
part.  Use N = 600 to execute the program.
</p>

<p>
Compare the actual state sequence (created and recorded during
the simulation) with the predicted state sequence (found with
Viterbi's algorithm) by computing their Hamming distance.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Output</h4>
</p>

<p>
Print to a file named on the command line that contains, interleaved,
<ol>
<li> The emitted sequence in rows of 60.
<li> The actual state sequence in rows of 60.
<li> The state sequence found by the optimization in rows of 60.
</ol>
Print them in 10 sets of triple lines, print 10 groups of the above 3
lines followed by a blank line after the computed state sequence.
</p>
<p>
Print the Hamming distance between the actual and the computed state
sequence on a final line in the form: dH = &lt; distance &gt;.
</p>
