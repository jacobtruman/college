<h3>
Find Locations Within the Rice Pseudomolecule Data Files <br/>
Do Some Comparison
</h3>

<li> <p>
     <em>Gibberellin</em> is one of 5 known types of plant hormones.
     (The others are Auxin, Absissic Acid, Cytokinin, and Ethylene)  Find
     all the records in the whole rice genome that has the word 'Gibberellin'
     in it, capitalized, upper and lower case.  Do this for the .seq and the
     .1kUpstream files, creating two files, all.gibberellin.1kUpstream and
     all.gibberellin.seq.
     The genes that have the word 'Gibberellin' in their tags split into two
     types:
     One for Gibberellin itself, and the other for other genes for whose
     expression Gibberellin acts as a regulator or a responder.  Leave only
     the ones for Gibberellin in the files.  Remove the others by hand if
     necessary.
     </p> </li>
<li> <p>
     Write a program that uses the .seq and the .1kUpstream files as input
     for each gene in .seq, and in .1kUpstream.  The .seq file records, here
     called 'seqRecord', starts at the first exon of a gene while the
     .1kUpstream
     records, here called '1kUpstreamRecord', contains the beginning of the 
     first exon at its tail.  (The sequences that start at the beginning of a
     record are called its <em>prefixes</em> and the sequences that are the
     tail of a record are called its <em>suffixes</em>.)  A prefix of the
     seqRecord data is contained as a suffix of the 1kUpstreamRecord data.
     In some cases, there is no 5'UTR data for the gene and so the
     seqRecord data starts at the last 'ATG' of the 1kUpstreamRecord data.
     The 'ATG' is a prefix of the seqRecord and the overlap sequence contains
     only this 'ATG'.
     </p> </li>
     <p>
     Find the point where the seqRecord data begins in the 1kUpstreamRecord
     data.  Use 35 base pairs of the 1kUpstreamRecord data before that point
     (upstream of that point) as the data sequence for a new record that has
     the same form of header as that of the 1kUpstream file except that the
     '1kUpstream' is replaced by 'PromoterTail' and the coordinates of the
     35 base pair sequence replaces the coordinates of the 1kUpstream data.
     Put this into a file named 'searchString.dat'.  If the 1kUpstreamRecord
     data does not include 35 base pairs before the beginning of the seqRecord
     start point, fill it by adding a prefix of 'N' to make 35 bp.
     </p> </li>
     <p>
     <li>
     Write a program that finds the median string of length 7 with the search
     strings as input.
     </p> </li>
     <li>
     <p>
     Turn it in as before, in a tar'd gzip'd file under the directory 
     '&lt;your-name&gt;/05' by Midnight, Sunday, 10/29/2006.
     </p> </li>
