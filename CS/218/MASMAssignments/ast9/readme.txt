Assignment #9 - Test Utility
----------------------------

This test utility will execute the assignment #9 program
multiple times with a series of pre-defined input's.
The output is captured to a file and compared to a known
correct master.

As such, the prompts and output strings used in assignment #9
must match exactly the specificiations in the assignment!

Place a copy of the assignment #9 executable file and
all files from the test utility into a subdirectory.

The batch file is named "a9tst".

The usage is as follows:

  c:\csc218\ast9test> a9tst <executable file>

For example, assuming the executable file is named
ast9.exe and using verbose mode, the command would be:

  c:\csc218\ast9test> a9tst ast9



-ed
