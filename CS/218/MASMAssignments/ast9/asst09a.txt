CSC 218, Section 01, 02
Homework,  Asst. #09

Purpose:  Become familiar with system services or I/O, data representation,
          program control instructions, stacks, and procedure handling.
Due:      Wednesday    (10/12)
Points:   115

Assignment:
Write a simple assembly language program to read race information from the
user (race name, race start day/time, and race length), calculate the race
end day/time, and display the final race information.  The provided main
program will call three routines as follows:

   * Procedure 1, "read_race_info", will read the race information
     (race name, race start day/time, and race length), perform error
     checking, and return the final race information (as integer). The
     procedure must perform complete error checking on the race name
     (3 character minimum, 20 character max), race start day (2 characters,
     Su/Mo/Tu/We/Th/Fr/Sa, case sensitive), race start time (hh:mm:ss,
     24-hour time format, leading 0's required) and the race length
     (hh:mm:ss, leading 0's required, 0-99 hours, 0-59 minutes, 0-59 seconds
     maximum, 00:00:00 not allowed).  The procedure should return a single
     integer for the day (0=Su, 1=Mo, etc.).  If there is an error in the
     input, display an appropriate message and re-prompt for just that field.
     Note, prompting and error messages must match the example exactly.
     As such, you must use the provided prompt and error message strings.

   * Procedure 2, "calc_end_time", compute and return the race end day and
     race end time based on the race start day/time and race length.

   * Procedure 3, "disp_race_info", to display the race information in the
     specified format (next page).  Display should include header, race name,
     race start day/time, and race end day/time.  The day must be formatted
     with the full day name.  The times must be displayed in the 12-hour
     AM/PM format (see example).  Note, output must match the example exactly
     (with regard to spacing and formatting).

You may use the integer/ASCII conversion code from assignment #6 (with
appropriate updates).


Note, your source must be placed into a separate file and linked with the
provided main.  Refer to the handout for directions how to link multiple
files.
