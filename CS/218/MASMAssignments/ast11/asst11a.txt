CSC 218, Section 01, 02
Homework,  Asst. #11

Purpose:   Become familiar with the MS-DOS system services.
Due:       Wednesday   (10/26)
Points:    125   (90 for program, 35 for documentation)


Assignment:
Write a program that will read a file specification from the command
line and update all the files meeting that specification to the
current date.  The program should allow a command line option of "/s"
or an "/v" before the file name specification. The "/v" (verbose) means
the that the file name and file date (before the update) should be
printed as per the example.  The "/s" (short) means that only the
file name (not the date) should be displayed.

Additionally, the program should print a header
message:  CSC218 Touch Utility, v1.0 
Refer to the example executions for samples of the expected output
formatting.

The program must perform basic error checking.  If no command line input
was entered or no files matching the specification an appropriate message
should be generated.  After an error message is printed, the program
should be terminated.  If the program is unable to update a file, a
message should be printed, and the program continue to the next file (if any).

You must use the provided main program (which must not be altered).
All procedures must be in a separate file.

Refer to Chapter 13 of the on-line text for additional information of the
various system services required to find the files, open the files, get
the current date, and set a new file date.

Example Executions:

Example #1:  For example (assuming the executable is named  "touch.exe")

      C:\temp> touch /v file?.txt
      CSC218 Touch Utility, v1.0
      
      FILE1.TXT           03/02/2005
      FILE2.TXT           03/02/2005
      FILE0.TXT           03/02/2005
      
      C:\temp>

would read the option ("/v"), the file specification ("file?.txt") and
then find all files matching that specification.  The files, "file1.txt",
"file2.txt", and "file0.txt" are listed along with the original file
dates.  After displaying the file name/date, the file dates will be
updated to 10/12/05.


Example #2:  For example (assuming the executable is named  "touch.exe")

      C:\temp> touch /v   file?.*
      CSC218 Touch Utility, v1.0
      
      FILE1.TXT           10/02/2005
      FILE2.TXT           10/02/2005
      FILE3.LST           10/02/2005
      FILE0.TXT           10/02/2005
      
      C:\temp>

Example #3:  For example (assuming the executable is named  "touch.exe")

      C:\temp> touch    /s  file?.*
      CSC218 Touch Utility, v1.0
      
      FILE1.TXT
      FILE2.TXT
      FILE3.LST
      FILE0.TXT
      
      C:\temp>

Example #4:  For example (assuming the executable is named  "touch.exe")

      C:\temp> touch   /v   file?.asm
      CSC218 Touch Utility, v1.0
      
      No files match provided specification.
      
      C:\temp>

Example #5:  For example (assuming the executable is named  "touch.exe")

      C:\temp> touch   /f   file?.asm
      CSC218 Touch Utility, v1.0
      
      Error, invalid command line option.
