        DL = column (00h is left)

Notes: a separate cursor is maintained for each of up to 8 display
       pages many ROM BIOSes incorrectly return the default size
       for a color display (start 06h, end 07h) when a monochrome
       display is attached

INT 10 - VIDEO - SCROLL DOWN WINDOW
      AH = 07h
      AL = number of lines by which to scroll down (00h=clear entire window)

INT 10 - VIDEO - READ CHARACTER AND ATTRIBUTE AT CURSOR POSITION
        AH = 08h
        BH = page number (00h to number of pages - 1) (see #0009)
Return: AH = character's attribute (text mode only) (see #0013)
        AH = character's color (Tandy 2000 graphics mode only)
        AL = character

Bitfields for character's display attribute:

Bit(s) Description (Table 0013)
 7	foreground blink or (alternate) background bright
 6-4	background color
 3	foreground bright or (alternate) alternate character set
 2-0	foreground color
SeeAlso: #0025

(Table 0014)
Values for character color:
	Normal		Bright
 000b	black		dark gray
 001b	blue		light blue
 010b	green		light green
 011b	cyan		light cyan
 100b	red		light red
 101b	magenta	light magenta
 110b	brown		yellow
 111b	light gray	white

--------V-1009-------------------------------
INT 10 - VIDEO - WRITE CHARACTER AND ATTRIBUTE AT CURSOR POSITION
        AH = 09h
        AL = character to display
        BH = page number (00h to number of pages - 1)
        BL = attribute (text mode) or color (graphics mode)
             if bit 7 set in <256-color graphics mode, character
             is XOR'ed onto screen
        CX = number of times to write character
Return: nothing
Notes: all characters are displayed, including CR, LF, and BS
       replication count in CX may produce an unpredictable result
       in graphics modes if it is greater than the number of positions
       remaining in the current row
SeeAlso: AH=08h

--------V-100E-------------------------------
INT 10 - VIDEO - TELETYPE OUTPUT
      AH = 0Eh
      AL = character to write
      BH = page number
      BL = foreground color (graphics modes only)
Return: nothing
Desc:	display a character on the screen, advancing the cursor and
      scrolling the screen as necessary

--------V-100F-------------------------------
INT 10 - VIDEO - GET CURRENT VIDEO MODE
        AH = 0Fh
Return: AH = number of character columns
        AL = display mode (see #0009 at AH=00h)
        BH = active page (see AH=05h)

--------V-1013-------------------------------
INT 10 - VIDEO - WRITE STRING (AT and later,EGA)
      AH = 13h
      AL = write mode
         bit 0: update cursor after writing
         bit 1: string contains alternating characters and attributes
         bits 2-7: reserved (0)
      BH = page number
      BL = attribute if string contains only characters
      CX = number of characters in string
      DH,DL = row,column at which to start writing
      ES:BP -> string to write
Return: nothing
Notes: recognizes CR, LF, BS, and bell
