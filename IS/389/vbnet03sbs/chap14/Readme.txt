Usage Tips
==========

You "win" the game by getting a 7 in one of the spinner windows when you click the Spin button. By my calculations, you will win the game about 28% of the time. Have fun!

To Uninstall in Microsoft Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Server 2003:

Click the Start button, click Settings, and then click Control Panel. Use the Add/Remove Programs tool to remove "Lucky" from the list of installed programs.
